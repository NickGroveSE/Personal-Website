Hello! As you saw above I am a Full Stack Developer and Web Designer, but my expertise lies mostly in Front-End Development. I am currently building up my skills to become a Freelance Developer and working on a really exciting project called [Iris](https://nickgrove.netlify.app/projects/Iris) that will utilize Spotify's Web API.
