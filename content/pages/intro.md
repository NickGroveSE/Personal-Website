As you saw above I am a Full Stack Developer, but my expertise lies mostly in Front-End Development and I am currently pushing to get my Back-End knowledge up to speed. Currently I am expanding my mastery in the Front-End Framework Vue.js, learning Golang, and soon want to work on my fundamentals such as Low Level Programming and Front-End Development without a framework to get a better grasp conceptually.

Right now I am Freelancing so if you are a business or organization that needs a website or want some designs contact me at nickgrove.se@gmail.com.
