This course was one of my favorites during my time at UIowa, because it felt like a big step towards real world solutions and complex problems. The way the course was organized was that we started with an introduction to Java and a written exam after the first month, but from this point all of work would be projects. We had "Oral Exams" where we were given a certain chunk of time to finish our selected projects, and essentially do a code review with our professor. 

I loved how this course was organized because it was very hands on, and I learned so much because of that. Also it prepared me more for the world of Software Engineering, it got me thinking more in-depth about project scope, system design, and time management.
