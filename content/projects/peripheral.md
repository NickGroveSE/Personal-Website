The concept for Peripheral is a website that at its core is media and content about the music industry, but moreover it makes a personalized experience that pushes you to discover musicians that are new to you. Peripheral as a fully finished site is a big undertaking so I primarily focused on the user interface design. This project was a lot of firsts for me, first time design something fully which included working with the website's aesthetic, color palette, and user experience. 

<div id="fig-1" style="display: block; max-width: 740px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <div style="display: inline; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 900; color: #42b883;">Figure 1:</div>
    <img  src="/peripheralshowcase.png" style="width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 0 0">
</div>

Another first was creating a showcase for my mockups, you can see a glimpse into that showcase above in Figure 1 and see the full showcase of the designs on the Behance link. While making the showcase it put me in a mindset that was fairly new to me, which was thinking about the design of my project from the standpoint of a customer or an investor. I am Developer at heart but Design is something I love to do as well, and this project was a formative introduction into the world of Web Design.
