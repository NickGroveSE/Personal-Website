For my return to Software Development, I wanted a project that was straightforward in its concept but something that exposes to a lot of new technologies. MTGMetaTracker was ultimately a great 
fit since I got to work with MongoDB, Express, EJS, parse5, and axios for the first time while also expanding my knowledge on CSS, JavaScript, and D3.js.
