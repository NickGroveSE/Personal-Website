Alvin is my introductory project to the programming language Go, and I have loved Go's similarities to C++, the first language I ever worked with. Currently Alvin only has a help and weather by city command since the early stages of this project was a lot of documentation reading of DiscordGo. I am pulling the weather data from this API called Tomorrow.io, it has been great to learn how to perform an API call and handle JSON in Go, and with the extensive weather data given from the API I will definitely expand on this command in the future. Alvin is meant to act as a virtual assistant, so I am always brainstorming new commands for him. Next, I would love to add a timer or to do list functionality.
