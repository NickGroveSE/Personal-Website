I was participating in the online Hackathon CAPTURETHEWORLD, and since the theme was social good I decided to create a Mobile App that would be a way for people to support their local businesses and non-profits, with an emphasis on fighting against gentrification. My inspiration for this app was the gentrification I see everyday in the city I live, Cincinnati. In the neighborhood OTR there is a polarizing example of this on a main road Liberty Street. On the South side of the street it is primarily White, new developments, and higher cost of living and on the North side of the street it primarily African American, abandoned buildings, and homelessness. I wanted to create a platform where businesses that are owned by people of color and/or heavily affected by gentrification can prosper.

CAPTURETHEWORLD was very welcoming to projects with no code or low code, so I wanted to put some heavy emphasis on the Design (Figure 1). I felt like this idea really challenged me on the Design side of things, and I would love to come back to it one day. Next steps if I ever come back to this project is fully fleshing out the Design, showcase it on Behance, and maybe one day get to programming it using a native framework but it would be a large undertaking.
