While in Headstarter AI's Software Engineering Fellowship, our team had an idea for a skincare app that could be used for personalized skincare advice based on a users skin type. We were all very passionate about this idea, and wanted to make a legitimate service for people to use, and so Freya was born. 

The design was spearheaded by the two team members with the most Frontend experience, myself and Serafin Patiño. I worked on the conceptual and graphic design such as the logo, 
website aesthetic, etc. and he worked on the UI/UX more. When it came to developing out the application I was the Frontend Developer, Serafin Patiño was Product Manager & Dev Ops, 
Mackenzie Eng was our Backend Developer, and Zainab Zaneer was our AI Specialist. Moving from the design and planning phase to development I have worked on building out our user interface 
and also work closely with Mackenzie on cohesive data transfer throughout the application. For our initial system design check out Figure 1.
