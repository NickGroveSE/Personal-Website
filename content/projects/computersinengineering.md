This was my first college course that dove into the more complex topics of programming. In a way you could say that my classes up to this point were more about "coding"/pure problem solving rather than what true programming is, which is building more complete projects. It was my second course in C++ and I feel lucky to have learn so much C/C++ early in my development career, I have always had a soft spot for it because it lays a good base for a beginner. 

This class had a heavy emphasis on Object Oriented Programming, and had a good mix of individual and group assignments. My favorite assignment of the course was the group project where we programmed a Pololu 3pi Robot to follow a black line. Following the line was the first hurdle, and from there we had to optimize our efficiency by having to navigate different terrains and handle changes in speed.
