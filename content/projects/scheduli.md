My goal for Scheduli was to create a sleek scheduling app for my first Full Stack application using Vue as my Frontend Framework and introduce myself to some new technologies. I decided on working with Laravel and PostgreSQL for the Backend to get my start in PHP and using modern, widely-used frameworks was important to me with this stack. When it came to the Frontend I wanted to explore as well with diving into Tailwind CSS and SASS, both of these feel like vital CSS tools for me being more Frontend-leaning.

Currently this project is in the beginning phases. Organizing the Relational Database, Design, and Planning my Backlog.
