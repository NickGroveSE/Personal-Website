My inspiration for this app was the gentrification I see everyday in the city I live, Cincinnati. In the neighborhood OTR there is a polarizing example of this on a main road Liberty Street. On the South side of the street it is primarily White, new developments, and higher cost of living and on the North side of the street it primarily African American, abandoned buildings, and homelessness. I wanted to create a platform where businesses that are owned by people of color and/or heavily affected by gentrification can prosper."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"id":"fig-1","style":"display: block; width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"style":"display: inline; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 900; color: #42b883;"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Figure 1:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"div","props":{"style":" font-size: 14px;"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Figma designs"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n    "},{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"src":"/urbanuncoverscreens.png","style":"display block; width: 100%; margin: 10px 0 50px 0"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"CAPTURETHEWORLD was very welcoming to projects with no code or low code, so I wanted to put some heavy emphasis on the Design (Figure 1).

Next steps if I ever come back to this project is fully fleshing out the Design, showcase it on Behance, and maybe one day get to programming it using a native framework but it would be a large undertaking."}]}],"toc":{"title":"","searchDepth":2,"depth":2,"links":[]}},"_type":"markdown","_id":"content:projects:urbanuncover.md","_source":"content","_file":"projects/urbanuncover.md","_extension":"md"},"hash":"QdCoBoTmns"}
